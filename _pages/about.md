I am (Full) Professor of Security and Privacy Enhancing Technologies at University College London ([UCL](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/)). I am affiliated with the [Computer Science Department](http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/) and currently serve as the Director of UCL's Academic Center of Excellence in Cyber Security Research ([ACE-CSR](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/cybersecurity-centre-of-excellence/)). 
Before joining UCL in 2013, I was a Research Scientist at [Xerox PARC](http://www.parc.com/).

Since 2018, I serve on the Technology Advisory Panel at the UK Information Commissioner's Office ([ICO](https://ico.org.uk/)). In 2016, I helped found the International Data-driven Research for Advanced Modeling and Analysis Lab ([iDRAMA Lab](https://idrama.science/)), a virtual lab involving researchers in USA and Europe.

### Research

Overall, I do research in the broad information security area. Recently, I have been doing a lot of work at the intersection of [machine learning and privacy](https://emilianodc.com/privacyML), as well as on understanding and countering [socio-technical issues on the Web](https://emilianodc.com/cybersafety/).

My research has been published at the four top-tier conferences in security (IEEE S&P, NDSS, ACM CCS, Usenix Security) as well top-tier conferences in other fields (e.g., WWW, ICWSM, CSCW, ACM IMC, ACM SIGMETRICS). My co-authors and I have received best/distinguished paper awards from NDSS, ACM IMC, and the CyberSafety Workshop, as well as the Data Protection by Design Award from the Catalan Data Protection authority, and were runners-up for best paper at ACM IMC, ICWSM, the CSAW Europe Applied Research Award, and the INRIA-CNIL Privacy Protection Award.

During my PhD, I also spent a few months on research internships at NEC in Heidelberg (2008), INRIA in Grenoble (2009), and Nokia in Lausanne (2010).

### Personal
I was born in Avellino, a small town in South of Italy on the hills of [Irpinia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irpinia). Irpinia is known for its green [landscapes](https://web.unisa.it/en/campus-life/surroundings/irpinia) and [medieval castles](http://www.irpinia24.it/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/header.jpg), its [soccer team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Avellino_1912), the hazelnuts, [black truffles](https://www.ecoturismocampania.it/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/tartufo-nero-di-bagnoli-irpino.jpg), and the [torrone](http://www.italymagazine.com/sites/default/files/story/torrone.jpg), as well as some great wines like Taurasi, Fiano di Avellino, and Greco di Tufo (which I know of only thanks to my brother [Paolo](http://tipicamente.it/curatori/paolo-de-cristofaro/) who is an amazing wine journalist).  

I have spent six awesome years in California (4 in Irvine and 2 in Palo Alto), before moving to (pre-Brexit, pre-Covid) London. I have also lived in Venice and Rome, and, briefly, in Portsmouth, Heidelberg, Singapore, Grenoble, Lausanne, and Barcelona.  

In my free time, I like acting as a coffee snob and a guerilla activist against pineapple on pizza, remembering (not without melancholy) the times I used to surf in San Onofre, cooking (only pasta and pizza, obviously) and planning trips (sigh) with my better half Darya and little one Maya.  

I love languages and I am kind of fluent in English, French, and Italian, and can utter enough words to get out of (or _in_) trouble in German, Spanish, and Persian.
