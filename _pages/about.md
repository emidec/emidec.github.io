I am (Full) Professor of Security and Privacy Enhancing Technologies at University College London ([UCL](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/)). I am affiliated with the [Computer Science Department](http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/) and currently serve as Head of the [Information Security Research Group](http://sec.cs.ucl.ac.uk/) and Director of the Academic Center of Excellence in Cyber Security Research ([ACE-CSR](http://sec.cs.ucl.ac.uk/ace_csr/)). 
Before joining UCL in 2013, I was a Research Scientist at [Xerox PARC](http://www.parc.com/).

I am also a Faculty Fellow at the [Alan Turing Institute](https://emilianodc.com/index.html) and on the Technology Advisory Panel at the UK Information Commissioner's Office ([ICO](https://ico.org.uk/)). In 2016, I co-founded the International Data-driven Research for Advanced Modeling and Analysis Lab ([iDramaLab](https://idrama.science/)).

### Research

Overall, I do research in the broad information security area. Recently, I have been doing a lot of work at the intersection of [machine learning and privacy](https://emilianodc.com/privacyML), as well as on understanding and countering [cybersafety issues](https://emilianodc.com/cybersafety/) using measurement studies and data science.

My research has been published at top-tier conferences such as IEEE S&P, NDSS, ACM CCS, WWW, ICWSM, ACM IMC. My co-authors and I have received best/distinguished paper awards from NDSS 2018, ACM IMC 2018, and CyberSafety 2019, as well as the Data Protection by Design Award from the Catalan Data Protection authority, and were runners-up for best paper at ACM IMC 2014, ICWSM 2017, the 2018 CSAW Europe Applied Research Award, and the 2019 INRIA-CNIL Privacy Protection Award.
