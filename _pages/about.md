I am a (Full) Professor of Security and Privacy Enhancing Technologies at University College London ([UCL](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/)). I am affiliated with the [Computer Science Department](http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/) and I currently serve as Head of the [Information Security Research Group](http://sec.cs.ucl.ac.uk/). I am also the Director of UCL's Academic Center of Excellence in Cyber Security Research ([ACE-CSR](http://sec.cs.ucl.ac.uk/ace_csr/)). 
Before joining UCL in 2013, I was a Research Scientist at [Xerox PARC](http://www.parc.com/).

I am also a Faculty Fellow at the [Alan Turing Institute](https://emilianodc.com/index.html), the national institute for data science and AI, and on the Technology Advisory Panel at the UK Information Commissioner's Office ([ICO](https://ico.org.uk/)). And, I am a member and co-founder of the International Data-driven Research for Advanced Modeling and Analysis Lab ([iDrama Lab](https://idrama.science/)).

## Education
- **PhD in Networked Systems, 2011**  
  University of California, Irvine  
  Advisor: Gene Tsudik  
  Dissertation: [Sharing Sensitive Information with Privacy](https://emilianodc.com/PAPERS/dissertation.pdf) 
- **BSc in Computer Science, 2005**  
  University of Salerno, Italy  
  Summa cum Laude, top 1% in graduating class
 
During my PhD, I also spent a few months on research internships at NEC in Heidelberg (2008), INRIA in Grenoble (2009), and Nokia in Lausanne (2010).

## Research

Overall, I do research in the broad information security area. Recently, I have been doing a lot of work at the intersection of [machine learning and privacy](https://emilianodc.com/privacyML), as well as on understanding and countering [cybersafety issues](https://emilianodc.com/idrama) using measurement studies and tools from data science.

My research has been published at top-tier conferences such as IEEE S&P, NDSS, ACM CCS, WWW, ICWSM, ACM IMC. My co-authors and I have received best/distinguished paper awards from CyberSafety'19, NDSS'18, and ACM IMC'18, and were runners-up for best paper at ACM IMC'14 and ICSWM'17.
