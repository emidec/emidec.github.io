title: About Me
---



I'm a Full Professor in the Department of [Computer Science and Engineering](https://www1.cs.ucr.edu) at the University of California, Riverside.
Until June 2023, I was at University College London ([UCL](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/)), where I served as Director of the Academic Center of Excellence in Cyber Security Research ([ACE-CSR](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/cybersecurity-centre-of-excellence/)) and Head of the Information Security Research Group ([ISRG](https://sec.cs.ucl.ac.uk)).

In September 2023, I founded the Security and Privacy Advanced research Lab ([SPALab](https://spalab.cs.ucr.edu)), a research group with members from both UCR and UCL.
I have a PhD from [UC Irvine](https://www.cs.uci.edu), advised by [Gene Tsudik](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~gts/).
During my PhD, I spent a few months on research internships at NEC in Heidelberg (2008), INRIA Rhone-Alpes (2009), and Nokia in Lausanne (2010).
After graduating, I worked as a Research Scientist at [Xerox PARC](http://www.parc.com/) from 2011 to 2013.

**Please note that I am not recruiting any new students (interns, masters, PhD, etc.) until September 2026. I apologize if I do not reply to inquiries about open positions.**

### Research

I am generally interested in impactful research in the broad Information Security field. Over the past few years, I have been focusing on [trustworthy machine learning](https://emilianodc.com/trustworthy-ML) and [socio-technical issues on the Web](https://emilianodc.com/cybersafety/).

My research has been published at top-tier conferences in security (IEEE S&P, NDSS, ACM CCS, Usenix Security) and other fields, e.g., ICML, NeurIPS, WWW, ACM IMC, ACM SIGMETRICS, ICWSM, CSCW, etc. My co-authors and I have received best/distinguished paper awards from NDSS, ACM CCS, CSCW, ICWSM, ACM WebSci, and ACM IMC, the Data Protection by Design Award from the Catalan Data Protection authority, and were runners-up for the CSAW Applied Research Competition and the INRIA-CNIL Privacy Protection Award. As a final piece of useless information -- I achieved the top-4 security "grand slam" in 2022 and 2024. In 2025, I was named Distinguished Member of the ACM for contributions to privacy-enhancing technologies and Internet measurement.

### Personal
I was born in Avellino, a small town in South of Italy surrounded by the mountains of the [Irpinia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irpinia) region. Irpinia is known for its green [landscapes](https://web.unisa.it/en/campus-life/surroundings/irpinia) and <a href="http://www.irpinia24.it/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/header.jpg" target="_blank">medieval castles</a>, the once-glorious [soccer team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Avellino_1912), hazelnuts and <a href="https://www.ecoturismocampania.it/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/tartufo-nero-di-bagnoli-irpino.jpg" target="_blank">black truffles</a>, as well as some great wines like Taurasi, Fiano di Avellino, and Greco di Tufo.  

In my free time, I like acting as a coffee snob and a guerilla activist against pineapple on pizza, nostalgically reminiscing about surfing in San Onofre, and cooking (only pasta and pizza, obviously).  

I have always loved languages and I'm (kinda) fluent in English, French, and Italian, and can utter enough words to get into trouble in German, Spanish, and Persian.

Kind request: my name is 'Emiliano' (first name) + 'De Cristofaro' (last name). 'De' is not a middle name, so please-please-please don't call me Mr/Dr/Prof. Cristofaro &ndash; it'd be like calling Robert De Niro 'Robert Niro' ([_you talking to me???_](https://youtu.be/-QWL-FwX4t4?si=r5EPjYF8toF6rEdw&t=52)).
