I am (Full) Professor of Security and Privacy Enhancing Technologies at University College London ([UCL](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/)). I am affiliated with the [Computer Science Department](http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/) and currently serve as Head of the [Information Security Research Group](http://sec.cs.ucl.ac.uk/) and Director of the Academic Center of Excellence in Cyber Security Research ([ACE-CSR](http://sec.cs.ucl.ac.uk/ace_csr/)). 
Before joining UCL in 2013, I was a Research Scientist at [Xerox PARC](http://www.parc.com/).

I am also a Faculty Fellow at the [Alan Turing Institute](https://emilianodc.com/index.html), an advisor to [Factmata](https://factmata.com), and on the Technology Advisory Panel at the UK Information Commissioner's Office ([ICO](https://ico.org.uk/)). In 2016, I co-founded the International Data-driven Research for Advanced Modeling and Analysis Lab ([iDrama Lab](https://idrama.science/)).

### Research

Overall, I do research in the broad information security area. Recently, I have been doing a lot of work at the intersection of [machine learning and privacy](https://emilianodc.com/privacyML), as well as on understanding and countering [cybersafety issues](https://emilianodc.com/cybersafety/) using measurement studies and data science.

My research has been published at top-tier conferences such as IEEE S&P, NDSS, ACM CCS, WWW, ICWSM, ACM IMC. My co-authors and I have received best/distinguished paper awards from NDSS 2018, ACM IMC 2018, and CyberSafety 2019, as well as the Data Protection by Design Award from the Catalan Data Protection authority, and were runners-up for best paper at ACM IMC 2014 and ICWSM 2017.

## Personal

I was born in Avellino, a small town in South of Italy on the green hills of [Irpinia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irpinia). Irpinia is known for its [landscapes](https://web.unisa.it/en/campus-life/surroundings/irpinia), [medieval castles](http://www.irpinia24.it/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/header.jpg), hazelnuts, [black truffles](https://www.ecoturismocampania.it/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/tartufo-nero-di-bagnoli-irpino.jpg), [torrone](http://www.italymagazine.com/sites/default/files/story/torrone.jpg), and some great wines like Taurasi, Fiano di Avellino, and Greco di Tufo (which I know of only thanks to my brother [Paolo](http://tipicamente.it/curatori/paolo-de-cristofaro/) who is a top wine journalist). I have spent six awesome years in California before moving to (pre-Brexit) London. I have also lived in Venice, Rome, Portsmouth, Heidelberg, Singapore, Grenoble, Lausanne, and Barcelona.

In my free(?) time, I like acting as a coffee snob and anti-pineapple pizza radical, remembering (with melancholy) the times I used to surf [San Onofre](http://www.parks.ca.gov/sanonofre/), cooking (only pasta and pizza, obviously), and planning trips with my better half Darya and little one Maya. I am fluent in English, French, Italian, and can utter enough words to get out of (or in, most of the times) trouble in German, Spanish, and Farsi.
