I am (Full) Professor of Security and Privacy Enhancing Technologies at University College London ([UCL](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/)). I am affiliated with the [Computer Science Department](http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/) and currently serve as the Director of UCL's Academic Center of Excellence in Cyber Security Research ([ACE-CSR](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/cybersecurity-centre-of-excellence/)).
Before joining UCL in 2013, I was a Research Scientist at [Xerox PARC](http://www.parc.com/).

### Research

I do academic research in the broad information security area. Recently, I have been focusing on problems at the intersection of [machine learning and privacy](https://emilianodc.com/privacyML), as well as on understanding and countering [socio-technical issues on the Web](https://emilianodc.com/cybersafety/) using a data-driven approach.

My research has been published at all four top-tier conferences in security (IEEE S&P, NDSS, ACM CCS, Usenix Security) as well top-tier conferences in other fields, such as ICML, WWW, ACM IMC, ACM SIGMETRICS, ICWSM, CSCW. My co-authors and I have received distinguished paper awards from NDSS, CSCW, ICWSM, and ACM IMC, the Data Protection by Design Award from the Catalan Data Protection authority, and were runners-up for the CSAW Applied Research Competition and the INRIA-CNIL Privacy Protection Award. In 2022, I achieved the security "grand slam," i.e., I had at least one paper in all four top-tier security conferences in the same calendar year.

### Education

During my PhD, I also spent a few months on research internships at NEC in Heidelberg (2008), INRIA in Grenoble (2009), and Nokia in Lausanne (2010).

### Personal
I was born in Avellino, a small town in South of Italy on the hills of [Irpinia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irpinia). Irpinia is known for its green [landscapes](https://web.unisa.it/en/campus-life/surroundings/irpinia) and [medieval castles](http://www.irpinia24.it/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/header.jpg), the [soccer team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Avellino_1912), the hazelnuts, and the [black truffles](https://www.ecoturismocampania.it/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/tartufo-nero-di-bagnoli-irpino.jpg), as well as some great wines like Taurasi, Fiano di Avellino, and Greco di Tufo (in fact, my smarter brother [Paolo](http://tipicamente.it/curatori/paolo-de-cristofaro/) became an amazing wine journalist).  

I have spent a few great years in California &ndash; in Irvine and Palo Alto (and it turns out I'm definitely more of a SoCal than a NorCal person), before moving to London. I have also briefly lived in Rome and near Venice, in Portsmouth (UK), Heidelberg, Singapore, Grenoble, Lausanne, Barcelona, and تهران.  

In my free time, I like acting as a coffee snob and a guerilla activist against pineapple on pizza, nostalgically remembering the times I used to surf in San Onofre State Beach, cooking (only pasta and pizza, obviously), and taking long walks with my better half Darya and little one Maya.  

I have alwyas loved languages and I'm kind of fluent in English, French, and Italian, and can utter enough words to get out of (or _in_) trouble in German, Spanish, and Persian.
