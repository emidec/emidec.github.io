## Open Positions Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

### 1. What is the standard teaching load?

We have two teaching terms (10 weeks plus 1 week break in the middle); ballpark, everyone teaches 1 class per term, but that might vary, e.g., based on the "size" of the class. Some classes are co-taught. Junior faculty often get reduced teaching load for the first 1-2 years. No or reduced teaching is common for grants like ERC or certain fellowships. We also have (paid) [sabbaticals](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/human-resources/sites/human_resources/files/sabbatical_leave_policy.pdf) of course &ndash; 1 term "off" every 3 years.

In addition, we supervise undergrad students for their final year projects and masters students for their summer project (also see 4. below), and serve as [personal tutors](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/academic-support/personal-tutors) for a few students a year.

### 2. Do you follow a specific Research/Teaching/Admin split (e.g. 50/40/10)?

At least in our department, we don't have an "official" split. Personally, I see our group as doing world-leading research, so research definitely is and very likely will continue to be the top priority for us. See 1. for teaching and 3. for admin.

### 3. What is the admin load?

A big, successful department like ours cannot function well, unless everybody pitches in. So I think everyone should do something. Personally, I encourage people to find what they feel they can do most productively or passionately, and take charge of that. 

Examples include: directing or doing the admissions for our MSc in Information Security, sitting in or leading some departmental committee, leading extra-curriculum activities for/with our students, etc. To be quite honest, the load is pretty low overall.

### 4. What about summers?

We are paid and have some work all year round. The teaching terms are Oct-Dec and Jan-Mar. Between late Apr and early Jun there is an exam session for classes of both terms (although some classes are homework/project only). Jun-Sep is dedicated to master's projects supervision, although you can do that remotely.

### 5. What is the Information Security (UCL ISec) group? Is it like a department? You are the Head of Group, will you be, like, my boss?

UCL's CS Department is huge (more than 100 academic staff according to [this list](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/computer-science/people/computer-science-academic-staff), which I don't even think is up to date). So, we are organized in about a dozen [research groups](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/computer-science/research/research-groups), which roughly reflect shared research interests. This helps (or at least is supposed to) scale up logistics.

As Head of Group, I am nobody's boss (although I usually am their "line manager", so I might need to occasionally sign some things) but I _represent_ the group in several meetings (including promotion and hiring committees), and help coordinate a few organizational and strategic things. You can think of me as an interface to the rest of the department and to "management" (Head of Department, Dean of the Faculty, etc.)


### 6. Are faculty positions tenure-track?

No. UCL doesn't have a tenure track. We have three "levels": Lecturer, Associate Professor, and (Full) Professor. All have the same "job description." You can think of Lecturer as the equivalent of Assistant Professor, although with no tenure review.

Most posts, at all levels, have a three-year "probation" period, which means faculty could be dismissed if they repeatedly fail to meet basic objectives with respect to, e.g., research and/or teaching expectations. Probation is not even remotely comparable to a tenure review process. E.g., there is no package to submit, or letters. Put simply, if we hire you, you should not be worried about it :)


### 7. How much do you pay?

UCL "pay scales" are [public](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/human-resources/sites/human_resources/files/21-22_ucl_non-clinical_grade_structure_with_spinal_points-202108.pdf). Associate Professor are appointed at Grade 9, Lecturers typically at Grade 8. Pay, spine points, etc. are to be negotiated with the Head of Department and HR. Full Professors are on a [banding structure](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/human-resources/pay-benefits/salary-scales/professorial-banding-structure-20212022).

### 8. Do you offer a start-up package?

Again, this is to be negotiated, but typically, yes, you can expect some "seed" funding for some equipment, travel, and student support.

### 9. How do you get promoted?

We have a transparent (yearly) [process](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/human-resources/policies-advice/academic-careers-framework-and-promotions-processes/academic-promotions-guidance). I think it works pretty well.

### 10. Where can I find more information about UCL?

Besides [https://www.ucl.ac.uk/about/](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/about/), I think the UCL HR Pay & Benefits [page](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/human-resources/pay-and-staff-benefits) is a really good resource for applicants.
